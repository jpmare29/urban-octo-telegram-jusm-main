# Code Refactor Starter Code
I started by reviewing the provided code and the assignment prompts.

I edited the CSS file first based on the html document I determined that there were more concise ways to make the CSS declarations
in order to remove redundant sections.

After that I fixed the broken link in the html file for the search-engine-optimization <div>.
I removed the unecessary class assignments in the html file because I commented them out from the CSS file.
I added the appropriate alt comments to the first three images but not the last three since I decided that those were just decorative.

I was having trouble getting the preview to display properly in github so I relocated the index.html file into the main file instead
of inside the Develop file.
I had to update the relative file paths since I relocated the index file but this seemed to fix the issue I was having with getting
the page to display with github
  
I will now remove the commented out CSS rules since I've made sure they're not necessary but I think this satisfies
all of the criteria set out in the challenge.
